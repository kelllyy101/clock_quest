## Project Planning and Development

### Project Inspection

Clock Quest is a web application aimed at providing an immersive and educational experience for users to improve productivity. The goal of the project is to create an engaging platform that showcases a diverse collection of pages of tips and interactive features for users to learn about timekeeping, productivity and efficiency.

### Project Statement

The purpose of Clock Quest is to foster curiosity and appreciation for various timekeeping methods. By offering an interactive and visually appealing platform, we aim to create an enjoyable learning experience for users of all ages, supplying them with skills, focus methods and apps to help achieve their time management goal.

The live website can be found [here](https://kelllyy101.github.io/clock_quest/)

### Target Audience

Clock Quest targets individuals interested in improving their time management, daily productivity and timekeeping of life. The application is suitable for hobbyists, students, and anyone curious about different ways to ensure proper time management and proper activity.

### Learning Goals

The project focuses on achieving the following learning goals:

- Building a responsive and user-friendly web application
- Enhancing knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Incorporating interactive elements using JavaScript
- Designing visually appealing and clear paragraphs with little to no distractions
- Implementing accessibility best practices

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to explore various types of methods to help with my daily productivity.
- As a user, I want to interact with the apps and experience their unique features.
- As a user, I want to customize the clock displays according to my preferences.
- As a user, I want to navigate easily between different aspects of productivity and time management.
- As a user, I want to access additional applications related to timekeeping through provided links.
- As a user, I want to subscribe to unlock additional features and receive updates from the blog post of the owner.

### Site Objectives

The main objectives of Clock Quest are as follows:

- Showcase a diverse range of time management tips with informative descriptions.
- Offer interactive functionality and advice, also allowing users to engage with apps.
- Provide customization options for apps to personalize the user experience.
- Design a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.
- Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Ensure a clear two-tone structure replicating a clock for easy legibility.

### Approach

The project will be developed using the following approach:

1. Conduct research on various types of time management and gather relevant information.
2. Create wireframes and design mockups to plan the layout and user interface.
3. Define a color scheme that aligns with the application's aesthetic and enhances user experience.
4. Select typography that complements the overall design and improves readability.
5. Develop responsive HTML and CSS code to build the front-end of the website.
6. Incorporate JavaScript to implement interactive features and user customization options.
7. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the website functions correctly across different devices and browsers.
8. Deploy the website to a hosting platform for public access.

## Features

Clock Quest includes the following key features:

- Main logo: A visually appealing and representative logo to establish the brand identity.
- Navigation bar: A persistent navigation bar for easy access to different pages with a different focus in each, related applications and an about sign-up page.
- Links to different apps: Additional applications related to timekeeping, providing users with a comprehensive experience.
- Sign-up form: Users can create accounts to unlock additional features and receive updates from the owner of the site.
- Access to three videos that help with focusing and reaching your time management goals.
- Footer: A footer section containing relevant information and links to social media platforms where you learn more about time management.

Possible Future Features:

- User profiles: Allow users to customize their profiles and save preferences or take snippets of the advise text to keep in their personal journal.
- Social sharing: Enable users to share their favorite apps and tips on social media.
- Interactive quizzes: Include quizzes to test users' knowledge about timekeeping methods.
- A survery would be a good way to see what the website is missing, for example, "What would you like to see more of?", and then a list of possible answers to do with time management, productivity, focus and wellness.
- More engagement with social media to reach more people.

## Testing

The following testing procedures were performed during the development of Clock Quest:

- Testing during development: Regular testing at each stage to ensure proper functionality and responsive design.
- Feature testing: Comprehensive testing of interactive features, such as alarm settings and time zone adjustments.
- Footer testing: Verification of links and information in the footer section.
- Typo errors: Thorough proofreading to identify and correct any typographical errors.
- Manual testing: Testing the website manually across different devices and browsers.
- Validator testing: Validation of HTML and CSS code to ensure compliance with web standards.
- Performance and accessibility testing: Utilization of Lighthouse tool to evaluate performance and accessibility aspects. Identified issues were addressed and optimized.
- Fixed bugs: List of bugs that were identified and successfully resolved.
- Unfixed bugs: Known bugs or issues that have not been resolved yet.
- Other known bugs: Additional bugs or issues that are documented for reference.

## Deployment

1. This project was created by creating a repository under the name clock_quest and checked to use the all branches check-box. 
2. I clicked the code drop down menu in the new repository and clicked on HTTPS and copied the link. I then went to the IDE Code Institute and pasted the link to open up my workspace. 
3. I used three commands to push my work to git hub : git add, git commit -m "", and git push. Close to the end up my project, there was a technical error with my browser that was showing me something different to my web on someone else's browser, even with the same code.
4. I opened a new branch to restart the main page of project, ran it locally and eventually merged the branch to the main to deploy it.

Clock Quest was deployed using the following steps:

1. Set up a hosting platform with Code Anywhere IDE.
2. Ensure all necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, media) are uploaded to the server, with style.css and images in a different folder called assets.
3. Configure any required server settings, such as DNS records or SSL certificates.
4. Test the deployed website to verify its functionality in the live environment.
5. Make the website publicly accessible by sharing the appropriate URL.


## Languages

Clock Quest primarily utilizes the following programming languages:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Software

The following software and tools were used in the development of Clock Quest:

- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code and Code Anywhere)
- Version control system (e.g., Git)
- Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Lighthouse (for performance and accessibility testing)
- Font Awesome (Font awesome Icons are used for the Social media links contained in the Footer section of the website.)
- Google Fonts(Google fonts are used throughout the project to import the Libre Baskerville and Cabin fonts.)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code is the Integrated Development Environment used to develop the Website.)
- GitHub (GithHub is the hosting site used to store the source code for the Website and Git Pages is used for the deployment of the live site.)
- Git (Git is used as version control software to commit and push code to the GitHub repository where the source code is stored.)
- Google Chrome Developer Tools (Google chromes built in developer tools are used to inspect page elements and help debug issues with the site layout and test different CSS styles.)
- balsamiq Wireframes (This was used to create wireframes for 'The Skeleton Plane' stage of UX design.).
- CSS Generator (This was used to convert the RGBA colour for the site to Hex.)
- Techsini (tecnisih.com Multi Device Website Mockup Generator was used to create the Mock up image in this README)
