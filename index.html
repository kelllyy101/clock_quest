                        Start by assessing your existing approach. How good are you at organizing your time so that you
                        get
                        the important things
                        done well? Can you balance your time between different activities? And when you do make time to
                        do
                        something, are you
                        able to focus â€“ and get it finished?
                        Good time management takes a shift in focus from activities to results. Being busy isn't the
                        same as
                        being effective. In
                        fact, for many people, the busier they are, the less they actually achieve.
